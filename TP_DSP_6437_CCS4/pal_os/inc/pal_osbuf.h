/** \file   pal_osBuf.h
    \brief  OsBUF Services Header File

    This file declares OS abstraction services for fixed length buffer
    memory management operations. The PAL module implementing these APIs
    is called OsBUF.

    The fixed size buffer pool is carved out of a predefined variable
    length memory segment constructed using OsBUF. With OsBUF, user
    can partition his memory such that each partition has a specified
    number of buffer chunks, each of which is exactly the same size.
 
    A given memory segment can host more than one buffer pool each of
    which is defined for a distinct fixed size buffer. Example, one
    could have 2 buffer pools in a given memory segment, one with buffers
    of length 512 bytes and other with buffers of 1024 bytes length.
